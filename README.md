# ObfuscationBasics
A little program to obfuscate your dirty txt file Oo

Attention: this isn't secure and don't use it on important file.
The program override the file and don't create a copy.

Anyway it could be fun to play with.


To run open a terminal (you need python 3.x I used 3.10.6)

Type 'python encrypter.py -[e/d] -[algoName] [fileName.extention] [key]'

[e/d]       : encrypt | decrypt
[algoName]  : caesar  | XOR
[key]       : int     | 8bits
