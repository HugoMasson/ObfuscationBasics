# ObfuscationBasics
A little program to obfuscate your dirty txt file Oo

Attention: this isn't secure and don't use it on important file.
The program override the file and doesn't create a copy.


To run open a terminal 
(python 3.x I used 3.10.6)

Type 'python encrypter.py -[e/d] -[algoName] [fileName.extention] [key]'

[e/d]       : encrypt | decrypt
[algoName]  : caesar  | xor
[key]       : int     | 8bits
